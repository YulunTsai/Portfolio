**Tool Used**: Python(pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, requests), API Access: IGDB API (OAuth2.0 with Twitch credentials)

**Project Overview**: This project explores relationships between game ratings, genres, and popularity using data retrieved from the IGDB API. The analysis is designed to demonstrate analytical and storytelling skills aligned with data analyst roles in the gaming industry.

**Conclusion**: This project demonstrates how structured game metadata and player engagement metrics can be used to uncover trends in genre performance, audience preferences, and market misalignments. While certain genres like RTS and RPG remain consistently high-rated, others such as Arcade and Simulator show more volatile reception, highlighting the creative risks in those categories. Importantly, the disconnect between popularity and quality reveals opportunities to surface ‚Äúunderrated gems‚Äù that may be overlooked due to visibility bias.

# **Analysis of World Happiness Report**

**Tool Used**: R with ggplot2, regclass [Code Link](https://github.com/YulunTsai/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Analysis_of_World_Happiness_Report.R)

**Project Overview**: This project explores the factors that influence public confidence in national governments using the World Happiness Report dataset. Unlike typical happiness score studies, this analysis focuses on the trust dimension, aiming to identify which variables (e.g., regional, economic, and social) best predict trust in government institutions across countries and years.

**Objectives**
- Investigate relationships between development indicators and Confidence in National Government
- Quantify which factors most significantly impact public trust
- Analyze trends and anomalies across regions and development levels
- Enhance data manipulation skills using dplyr, magrittr, and base R

**Conclusion**: The analysis revealed that Region, Freedom of Life Choice, and Generosity are the most influential factors in predicting public confidence in national governments‚ÄîRegion alone accounts for over 32% of the variance. Interestingly, Healthy Life Expectancy showed a weak but negative correlation, especially among developing countries, prompting deeper consideration of socio-political dynamics beyond economic or health indicators.
